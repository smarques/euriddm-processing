euriddm-processing
==================

Euriddm is a pattern generator and visualizer.
It overlays three separate rhythmic patterns.

Each pattern is generated using Euclidean Rhythm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_Rhythm)

The reference for implementing the algorhythm was this excellent paper by Godfried Toussaint: 
http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf

I changed the algorhythm slightly to include multiple accent dynamic, so that each measure has one main accent but can 
also have seconday accents.

This code was written in the Processing Environment and uses the following open source libraries:
