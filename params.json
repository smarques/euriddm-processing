Made with Processing.","body":"euriddm-processing\r\n==================\r\n\r\nEuriddm is a pattern generator and visualizer.\r\nIt overlays three separate rhythmic patterns.\r\n\r\nEach pattern is generated using Euclidean Rhythm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_Rhythm)\r\n\r\nThe reference for implementing the algorhythm was this excellent paper by Godfried Toussaint: \r\nhttp://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf\r\n\r\nI changed the algorhythm slightly to include multiple accent dynamic, so that each measure has one main accent but can \r\nalso have seconday accents.\r\n\r\nThis code was written in the Processing Environment and uses the following open source libraries:\r\n\r\ncontrolP5:\r\nhttp://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/\r\n\r\nbeads project:\r\nhttp://www.beadsproject.net/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
